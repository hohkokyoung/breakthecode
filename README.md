BreakTheCode - Code Solver System

This is a web application inspired from the book "Hacking APIs" by Corey J. Ball, created using Django and React to challenge the users to decode a 6-digit code, bundled using Docker.

Rules:
1. Don't peek under the backend code.
2. One can bypass the throttling of the guessing attempt by simply rotating the IP address, so for your own challenge, just skip that method.
3. Have fun :)

Do reach out to me for any improvements that can added into the system, as well as other ways you have broken into the system without using the hints, email me at kokyoung1520@gmail.com.
